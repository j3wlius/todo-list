# Todo List App

This is a simple Todo List web application that I have built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks from the list.

## Features

- **Add Task:** Users can input a task in the input field & add it to the task list by clicking the "ADD" button.

- **Mark as Completed:** Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking on the checkbox next to each task or on the task itself.

- **Delete Task:** Users can delete tasks from the list by clicking the cross icon on the right of each task.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** I used HTML for structuring the webpage and creating the user interface elements.

- **CSS:** I used CSS for styling the webpage.

- **JavaScript:** I used Javascript for implementing the interactive features of the Todo List app like adding tasks, checking completed tasks & deleting tasks.
